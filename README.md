## TierTok

TierTok is a proof-of-concept platform that categorizes videos into distinct categories and tiers. Within each tier, content creators are compensated according to a custom algorithm that balances engagement metrics and content quality. This approach not only addresses the issue of creators competing solely within their own categories but also ensures that high-quality, emerging creators are fairly rewarded and supported.

## Features
1. **Value Evaluation Algorithm**: The **Final Tier Score (FTS)** algorithm serves as the primary tool for evaluating content value. Moving beyond simple engagement metrics, it introduces the Quality Multiplier (QM), a unique component designed to provide a significant boost to high-quality content that has not yet achieved widespread virality. The algorithm's sophistication lies in its combination of a logarithmic Raw Engagement Score (RES) and the exponential decay of the QM, ensuring a fair and nuanced assessment of all content.

2. **Tiered, Categorical Pool System**: This system establishes a merit-based reward structure by first organizing content into distinct categories using a **clustering algorithm**. After this categorization, the **Final Tier Score (FTS)** is used to rank videos within each cluster. Based on their FTS, videos are assigned to specific tiers (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum). This approach ensures that rewards are distributed equitably, based on both content quality and genuine engagement.

3. **Fraud Detection Bot**:
